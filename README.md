Assignment 1 Instructions:

When beggining the program, you will be taken to a menu and the array will already be created and loaded
with the values from "A1input.txt". The program will list the options, then ask the user for their input from 0 to 5:

0) Print Array
  This funtion will print the array for the user to see.

1) Search in Array
  This function will ask the user to enter the value they are looking for. If the value is found in the
  array, it will print out the index it was found. Otherwise, it will display a message that the value
  was not found.

2) Update Array
  This function will ask the user to enter the index they'd like to update as well as the value they'd like to put at
  that index, then the function will return an updated version of the array and the value replaced and the new value there.
  If the index is out of bound for the given array, an error message will be displayed.

3) Add Number to End
  This function will ask the user to enter a number and then adds that number to the end of the array. Then the update array
  is displayed.

4) Delete from Array
  This function will ask the user to enter an index of the array and will delete the value at that index as well as print the
  value deleted. If the index entered is out of bounds for the given array, an error message will be displayed.
